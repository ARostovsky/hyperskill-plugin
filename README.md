**As a learner**, you can study programming while gaining experience with professional development tools. 
Join a step-by-step course, work on real-world projects, complete missions, participate in contests, or try them all.

**As an educator**, you can create your own courses and share them with others either privately or publicly. 
Combine theoretical learning and hands-on practice, test user knowledge with different sets of tasks, and provide extra assistance with feedback and hints.
