 * This factory is used to create file contents during deserialization of [EduFile], [TaskFile].

 * In this case, we need to make file contents point somewhere outside the deserialized JSON or YAML.
 *
 * When we deserialize YAML, we need to point to the learning objects storage.
 * When we deserialize JSON from a `course.zip` file, we need to point to some file inside `course.zip`.
