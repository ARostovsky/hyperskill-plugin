/**
 * Contains general information about course: [Course] object itself and where it's located.
 * It's supposed to be used for course-related generation like generation of whole course content or new task creation
 *
 * Main purpose of this class to have common interface for two contexts:
 * - [Project] object is not available but [course] and its [courseDir] are already known.
 *   For example, course content generation
 * - [Project] is available and [Course] and its root directory can be retrieved from project itself
 *
 * Generic parameter [T] is introduced to require proper nullability of [course] object
 * and avoid unexpected checks of [course] for null
